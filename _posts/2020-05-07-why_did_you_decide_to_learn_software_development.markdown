I was first exposed to programming in my sophomore year of high school. Our school offered AP Computer Science, which is taught in Java. I went on to study chemical engineering in college. All engineering curriculums require two semesters of computer science credit for graduation. I used AP credit to check off one semester's requirements and took a semester of MATLAB to fulfill the second requirement.

My first job out of college was at a company called Aspen Technology. They are a software company that makes software used by process engineers to design and operate chemical processes. I was not hired as a software developer. Rather, my role was as a technical consultant to work directly with end-users and deliver services such as technical support, sales demonstrations, training courses, and solution implementation. Some of the software offered by Aspen Technology include features to allow user customization, such as scripts, automation, and extensions. These features are designed for advanced users and require knowledge of coding. Since many customers utilized these features, there was a need for consultants to support these customers. We had internal training sessions to introduce some consultants to programming. After attending these sessions, it rekindled what I had learned in school and sparked a new interest and curiosity in coding. I picked up more languages like Visual Basic and C#. I began taking more and more responsibility for supporting customers with programming questions because it was something I enjoyed doing and because it was a way for me to stand apart from the rest of my cowokers. 

After three years at Aspen Technology, I began pursuing other opportunities. I started working as a process engineer in the oil/gas industry. While my primary discipline was process (chemical) engineering, the hiring managers always took a special interest in my programming background. I did get some chances to write programs to help with performing engineering calculations and automation, but I began to feel disillusioned with my day-to-day responsibilities. I did not find process engineering to be as intellectually stimulating or engaging as I had expected. In fact, I would describe the works as quite menial and mundane. I started doubting my choice of careers and began contemplating making a full career switch into software engineering. However, my resume was lacking to be hired as a full-time developer because I did not have knowledge of the languages/technologies that are in-demand.

In March 2020, I was laid off due to the coronavirus pandemic and drop in demand for oil. The outlook on the oil/gas industry is quite grim for the foreseeable future, so after months of contemplating, I finally decided to enroll in a full-time coding bootcamp to build my resume and venture into software development.
